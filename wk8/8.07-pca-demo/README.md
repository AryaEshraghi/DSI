# PCA Demos

There are two notebooks here that demonstrate various aspects of PCA.

1. [dimensionality-reduction-image-classification.ipynb](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-4/8.X-demo-kernel-pca/blob/master/dimensionality-reduction-image-classification.ipynb) performs image classification on handwritten digits.  We can reduce the dimensionality of this data substantially and still maintain good accuracy!
2. [kernel-pca-demo.ipynb](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-4/8.X-demo-kernel-pca/blob/master/kernel-pca-demo.ipynb) delves into the mysterious world of the kernel trick applied to PCA.  We see how nonlinear structure can be extracted using kernel PCA.  A review of linear PCA is also included as a counterpoint to kernel PCA.
