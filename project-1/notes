consider comparing mean scores between states with mandatory participation and low participation where students opt-in and are therefore generally better prepared (last part is an assumption)
would have loved to have more information on the number of data points per metric
states with low participation rates for both are good for expansion
how hard is it to compete when act participation is high?
