## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*
1. **Use** six probability rules, including Bayes' Theorem.
2. **Intuitively explain** how Bayes' Theorem can be used as a modeling tactic.
3. **Implement** Naive Bayes in `scikit-learn`.
4. **Discuss** assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages of Naive Bayes as a classifier.
